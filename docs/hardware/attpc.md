# The Active Target Time Projection Chamber

The Active Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC) is a flagship detector at the
Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University. Below are some
relevant details for using the detector. For more comprehensive overviews see the 
[publications](../publications.md).


## The Standard Trigger

Below is a a diagram of the standard trigger logic used in AT-TPC experiments. The
trigger requires a coincidence between a delayed ion chamber signal and a signal on
the Micromegas mesh. This makes the trigger a constant time reference based on the ion
chamber. Typically an additional downscaled ion chamber trigger is also included.
